This is nss_nonlocal, an nsswitch module that acts as a proxy for other 
nsswitch modules like hesiod, but prevents non-local users from 
potentially gaining local privileges by spoofing local UIDs and GIDs.

To use it, configure /etc/nsswitch.conf as follows:

passwd:         compat nonlocal
passwd_nonlocal: hesiod
group:          compat nonlocal
group_nonlocal: hesiod
